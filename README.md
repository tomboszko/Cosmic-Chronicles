## My feedback

I don't really had issues with the Javascript side, and I found a way to enter many object in a short time (when others where inputing about 5 objects, I inputed 48. 

I asked to ChatGPT to create a board with all the cards and for each card, his specs. I also asked him to define a univers to have some fun context.

So, all the names, types, etc... are from Chat GPT.

Then,

`Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` to Excel, I have some good skills at it.

SO, in Excel, I have just reorganised the data from ChatGPT, then, using just a validation list, a vlookup and a concatenate function, Excel provided me an object for each cards in a javascript syntax.

I also made a prompt using the description of the cards and send it to BingAI to generate some good illustrations ands It worked !!!.
